## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

During this challenge I learned absolute positioning of the icon that you can see on top of the image on hover. I also learned to make an overlay color effect that you can see on hover.

### Continued development

I need to learn a bit more about absolute positioning and read about it.
